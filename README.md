======================

Code Challenge for the 9/29/2014 SD AngularJS Study Group


There is a large JSON object in the data.js file.  This contains stats about the season opening SD Charger's game aginst Arizona.  Hooray!  

Challenge ideas:

* Display running, receiving, passing, tackling, special teams data that is filterable by team
* If the above is easy for your team, consider offering unique layouts for each kind of statistic (hint: directives!)
* Bonus:  Add a search form that can display stats for any given player
* Super Bonus:  The JSON stats object includes a play by play for each team for the entire game.  Find a way to easily display each play in a sequential fashion.
